Sequencer is a simple step sequencer capable of playing row- or column-wise. Moves are public and will influence
the grid of up to 3 concurrent users; this behavior can be disabled by clicking the wavy-hand.

Each color corresponds to a specific sound -- you can add / remove sounds by changing the templates in
'soundbites.js'.

If using Chrome, in 'sequencer.js', you can set recordingEnabled = true and use your mic to create new soundbites.
This feature isn't stable and is disabled by default.

It's a work in progress -- kindly let me know of any bugs you find :)
